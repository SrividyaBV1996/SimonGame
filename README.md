# Simon Game 

An interesting memory game in which one has to remember the order the blocks are clicked. It is developed using Javascript and JQuery.

First the user has to press any key to start the game.

The blocks are programmed to be clicked in a random way. The user has to remember the order in which the blocks are being clicked and repeat the same. The number of blocks clicked increases with each level.

If the user fails to repeat the order, he has to start over.
